## Project Domain
Diabetes is the one global chronic disease that will have an impact on life quality and premature death. Based on research conducted by Takashima *et al*. (2024) in *Journal of Epidemiology*, diabetes significantly reduces healthy life expectancy in Japan—both men and women—and is categorized as influenced by risk factors such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and smoking habits.

Furthermore, according to the American Diabetes Association by Wild *et al*. (2004), diabetes prevalence sharply increases when people get older, making the older generation more vulnerable to this disease. Additionally, gender also plays a crucial factor in diabetes development. According to Regitz-Zagrosek (2012), biological and hormonal differences contribute to variations in how men and women experience chronic illnesses such as diabetes. For example, men are more likely to develop diabetes at lower BMI values, while women with hormonal conditions like PCOS are at higher risk. This fact shows diabetes cannot only cause physical complications but also shorten a person's disability life span. Therefore, early detection and intervention are even more essential to maintaining the quality of the community.

Advancements in technology have enabled the utilization of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning, which can be applied to predict the probability of people having diabetes based on their medical data. This project focuses on predictive analytics and aims to compare Machine Learning model classification to know what models can make the diagnosis process efficient and accurate.

## Business Understanding
### Problem Statements
- How to predict diabetes risks based on the factors which is blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, age and gender?
- How to use Machine Learning for increasing the accuracy to detect the diabetes risks?
- What the most effective algorithm for analyze medical data and predict the probability of people who have diabetes and how these models can improve efficiency for diagnosis process?

### Goals
- Indentify and understand the main risk factors (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, age and gender) that can influence diabetes prediction and how they can be used on Machine Learning model for accurate diagnosis.
- Build prediction model using medical data and risks factors to give early diagnosis that more efficient and accurate.
- Compare each Machine Learning algorithm to knowing which one can give high accuracy to predict diabetes risk, and optimalize model to get the better result.
